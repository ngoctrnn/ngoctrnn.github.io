    <p>I am a newbie in the art field who is still learning how to create art step-by-step. I've been experiencing and working in different types of art mediums, and I must say I'm really interested in digital art, especially creating digital videos. I honestly think that videos are one of the most engaging mediums we can use to create art. Videos naturally draw people's attention by the movement they produce and also tend to strike a deep connection and strong emotional responses from the viewers. For me, videos are a way of communicating to others, like a language that we not only can see, but immediately feel at the moment. </p>

    <p>When creating a video, I start off thinking about what kind of content I should bring and share with my viewers. I always want to make something that is related to me and my personal experience, so that I can have a stronger connection with them. For example, Hypnagogia is a project that portrays a dream-like stage of sleep and how our brains are capable of doing while we're sleeping. It's amazing to see how it accounts for the bizarre imagery and auditory experiences we can have even when we're asleep. By doing works that connect to me, I feel like I'm sharing my world to others, which I can never do verbally. </p>
